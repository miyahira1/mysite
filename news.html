            <h2>JP Morgan: 24-Hour News Digest</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Strategy:</strong> Analysts at JP Morgan have upgraded their forecast for China's economic growth in 2024, citing stronger-than-expected Q1 data and supportive policy measures. This has influenced recommendations on emerging market equities.</li>
                <li><strong>Work & Culture:</strong> The bank continues its push for a return-to-office mandate, with recent internal communications emphasizing the importance of in-person collaboration for junior staff development and overall productivity. This remains a key topic among employees on professional networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina Operations:</strong> JP Morgan's local research team highlighted Argentina's recent fiscal surplus as a positive signal for investors. However, they maintain a cautious outlook, pointing to the challenges of sustaining austerity and the need for congressional approval of key structural reforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Commentary:</strong> Following Nvidia's blockbuster earnings report, JP Morgan strategists noted that the AI-driven tech rally has "more room to run," though they advise clients to remain diversified as market breadth is a growing concern.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Argentine Economic Indicators</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dólar Blue:</strong> The price is currently around <strong>$1,230</strong> for purchase and <strong>$1,250</strong> for sale. This represents a slight stabilization after recent volatility, but the market remains attentive to central bank interventions and inflation data. Projections suggest continued pressure as long as currency controls ("cepo") remain in place.</li>
                <li><strong>Riesgo País (Country Risk):</strong> The index is hovering around <strong>1,255 points</strong>. It has seen a significant decrease in recent months but has ticked up slightly this week amid political noise surrounding the "Ley Bases" debate in Congress. A successful negotiation could push the index lower, while a failure could trigger a negative reaction.</li>

            <h2>Market Snapshot & Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF):</strong> $529.55 <span class="negative">(-0.25% in 24h)</span>
                    <p class="analysis">The market is taking a breather after reaching all-time highs. Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, driven by strong tech earnings (especially from Nvidia), but tempered by recent Federal Reserve minutes suggesting interest rate cuts may be further off than anticipated. Indicators show the market might be slightly overbought, suggesting potential for short-term consolidation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>$BTC (Bitcoin):</strong> $69,450.10 <span class="negative">(-0.80% in 24h)</span>
                    <p class="analysis">Bitcoin is consolidating below the key $70k resistance level. The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. has created a "sell the news" event for ETH and a ripple effect across the crypto market. Sentiment is mixed, with bulls pointing to institutional adoption and bears concerned about macroeconomic headwinds. The price is currently caught between major support and resistance zones.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>$ETH (Ethereum):</strong> $3,785.42 <span class="positive">(+1.15% in 24h)</span>
                    <p class="analysis">Ethereum is outperforming the broader market following the landmark SEC approval for several spot ETH ETFs. This is seen as a major validation for the asset. While the price surged on the news, it's now finding a new range. Market sentiment is strongly bullish, with projections focusing on the massive potential inflows once the ETFs begin trading. The key driver is no longer speculation, but the mechanics of the ETF launch.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microsoft Build Announcements:</strong> Microsoft unveiled "Team Copilot," turning its AI assistant into an active meeting facilitator and project manager within Teams. They also announced "Phi-3-vision," a small, powerful multimodal AI model capable of running directly on mobile devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Google's Veo & Imagen 3:</strong> While announced last week, new demos and technical details for Google's most advanced text-to-video model (Veo) and text-to-image model (Imagen 3) were released, showcasing significant improvements in realism, prompt understanding, and text rendering in images.</li>
                <li><strong>Scarlett Johansson vs. OpenAI:</strong> A major public story erupted as actress Scarlett Johansson stated that OpenAI's new "Sky" voice assistant sounds "eerily similar" to her own, after she had previously declined an offer to voice it. OpenAI has since paused the use of the voice. This has ignited a widespread debate on AI ethics, consent, and the use of personal likeness.</li>
                <li><strong>Hugging Face & Pollen Robotics Partnership:</strong> The AI platform and robotics company announced a collaboration to develop open-source, AI-powered humanoid robots, aiming to democratize access to advanced robotics research and development tools.</li>
