            <h2>Market Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> $530.25 <span class="up">(+0.15%)</span></li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The market is showing slight gains in a low-volatility environment as investors await comments from Federal Reserve officials this week for clues on future interest rate policy. Sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with technical indicators like the RSI suggesting neutral to slightly overbought conditions. Corporate earnings season winding down leaves macroeconomic data as the primary market driver.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>$BTC (Bitcoin)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> $71,250.40 <span class="up">(+6.8%)</span></li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bitcoin surged above the $71k mark, driven by renewed optimism around the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in the U.S. This has created a "risk-on" sentiment across the crypto market. The Fear & Greed Index has shifted firmly into "Greed," indicating strong bullish momentum. Resistance is now eyed at the previous all-time high.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>$ETH (Ethereum)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Price:</strong> $3,785.15 <span class="up">(+21.5%)</span></li>
                <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Ethereum has massively outperformed the market following reports that the SEC may be leaning towards approving spot ETH ETFs. Bloomberg analysts raised their approval odds from 25% to 75%, causing a short squeeze and a surge in buying pressure. This regulatory news is the sole driver of the dramatic upward movement, overriding other technical and market indicators.</li>
