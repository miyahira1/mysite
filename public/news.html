            <h2>JP Morgan: Latest 24hs News</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Strategy:</strong> Analysts at JP Morgan have reiterated a cautious stance on US equities, citing high valuations and potential for a market pullback. They advise clients to consider diversifying into undervalued international markets.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Culture:</strong> A recent internal memo highlighted the firm's ongoing hybrid work model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of in-office "apprenticeship and collaboration" days while maintaining flexibility. The firm continues to be a top recruiter on college campuses for finance and tech roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina Outlook:</strong> JP Morgan's latest report on Argentina noted the government's fiscal progress but highlighted upcoming challenges related to lifting currency controls ("cepo"). The bank's EMBI index, which calculates country risk, remains a key indicator for international investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Investment:</strong> The bank announced a strategic partnership with a leading AI firm to enhance its fraud detection algorithms, aiming to reduce false positives and improve security for its millions of customers worldwide.</li>

            <div class="economic-item">
                <h3>Dólar Blue</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> Compra: <strong>$1,225</strong> / Venta: <strong>$1,245</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> The blue dollar remains stable, showing a slight decrease in the last session. The gap ("brecha") with the official dollar is currently hovering around 35%.</p>
                <p><strong>Projections:</strong> Market analysts expect continued stability in the short term, pending new economic measures and Central Bank interventions. The upcoming aguinaldo (half-year bonus) payments could introduce temporary volatility.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="economic-item">
                <h3>Riesgo País (Country Risk)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Value:</strong> <strong>1,289</strong> basis points</p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> Argentina's country risk has shown a slight increase in recent days, reflecting investor uncertainty regarding negotiations with the IMF and the long-term sustainability of fiscal adjustments.</p>
                <p><strong>Projections:</strong> The indicator's trajectory is heavily dependent on positive signals from the government regarding its economic program and its ability to build foreign reserves. A value below 1,200 points is seen as a key psychological target.</p>

            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> <strong>$545.80</strong> (<strong>-0.25%</strong>)</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Sentiment is cautious as investors await key inflation data (PCE index) later this week. The market is trading in a tight range, with technical indicators like the RSI suggesting a neutral-to-slightly-overbought condition. Movements are primarily driven by macroeconomic expectations rather than company-specific news.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>$BTC (Bitcoin)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> <strong>$60,950.45</strong> (<strong>-1.80%</strong>)</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bitcoin is facing downward pressure, testing the critical $60k support level. The sentiment is bearish in the short term, influenced by reports of sales from the German government and Mt. Gox wallet movements. Long-term holder metrics, however, show continued accumulation, suggesting a possible divergence between spot price and underlying strength.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>$ETH (Ethereum)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> <strong>$3,365.20</strong> (<strong>-2.15%</strong>)</p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Ethereum is following Bitcoin's downward trend, further impacted by a lack of immediate catalysts following the approval of Spot ETH ETFs. Market sentiment is mixed; while the short-term price action is weak, the potential for significant institutional inflows once the ETFs begin trading provides a bullish mid-term outlook.</p>
