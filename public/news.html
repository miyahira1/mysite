        <!-- JP Morgan News -->
        <h2>JP Morgan: 24h Update</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global:</strong> JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee, with expectations he will discuss economic stability, inflation, and regulatory frameworks. The bank's analysts also released a note suggesting that while market volatility has decreased, underlying geopolitical risks remain a key concern for investors.</li>
            <li><strong>Workplace/Hiring:</strong> The bank continues its push into AI and tech talent acquisition. Recent job postings highlight a focus on machine learning engineers and data scientists, aiming to integrate AI deeper into trading, risk management, and client services.</li>
            <li><strong>In Argentina:</strong> JP Morgan's local division maintained its "underweight" recommendation for Argentine sovereign bonds, citing persistent macroeconomic uncertainty despite recent fiscal adjustments. The firm's "Riesgo País" index, which it calculates, remains a critical benchmark for the country.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Argentine Financials -->
        <h2>Argentine Market Snapshot</h2>
        <h3>Dólar Blue</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="price-tag">Current Price:</span> ARS $1,265
                <span class="change-tag negative">↓ -1.17% (Recent Change)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Projections:</strong> The informal dollar saw a slight decrease after recent volatility. Analysts suggest the price may stabilize around this level in the short term, pending new signals from the Central Bank regarding interest rates and currency controls. The gap with the official dollar remains a key focus.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Riesgo País (Country Risk)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="price-tag">Current Level:</span> 1,412 points
                <span class="change-tag positive">↑ +0.50% (Recent Change)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Projections:</strong> The Country Risk index ticked up slightly, reflecting cautious sentiment from international investors. While it remains significantly lower than its peaks, any upward movement is watched closely as an indicator of perceived risk in Argentine assets. Future trends depend heavily on the government's ability to sustain fiscal discipline and progress in negotiations with external creditors.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Global Markets -->
        <h2>Global Markets: SPY, BTC, ETH</h2>
        <h3>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="price-tag">Current Price:</span> ~$534.50
                <span class="change-tag negative">↓ -0.15% (24h)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The market shows slight consolidation after recent gains. Sentiment is neutral-to-cautious as investors await key inflation data later this week. The VIX (volatility index) remains low, but trading volumes are moderate, suggesting a "wait-and-see" approach. Any surprises in CPI data could trigger the next significant move.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>$BTC (Bitcoin)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="price-tag">Current Price:</span> ~$67,500
                <span class="change-tag negative">↓ -2.50% (24h)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bitcoin is facing downward pressure after failing to break the $70,000 resistance level. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has shifted from "Extreme Greed" to "Greed," indicating cooling sentiment. The movement is largely technical, with some profit-taking and reduced inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs observed over the past day. Support is being tested around the $66,000 level.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>$ETH (Ethereum)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="price-tag">Current Price:</span> ~$3,500
                <span class="change-tag negative">↓ -3.80% (24h)</span>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Ethereum is underperforming Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, correcting more sharply. This follows a period of strong performance driven by speculation around spot Ether ETFs. The market is now pricing in the reality that ETF launches and subsequent inflows may take time. The decline is seen as a healthy correction, but a break below $3,400 could signal further downside.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- AI Developments -->
        <h2>Top AI Developments (24h)</h2>

            <li><strong>Apple Announces "Apple Intelligence":</strong> At its WWDC event, Apple officially unveiled its suite of AI features, named "Apple Intelligence."

Notably, Apple announced a partnership to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT for more complex queries.</li>
            <li><strong>Perplexity Unveils "Pages":</strong> AI search engine Perplexity has launched a new feature called Pages, which allows users to convert their search queries and research into structured, shareable articles, reports, or guides. The tool automatically organizes information, cites sources, and allows for customization, positioning itself as a competitor to traditional content creation workflows.</li>
             <li><strong>Elon Musk Threatens Apple Ban:</strong> Following Apple's announcement of its OpenAI integration, Elon Musk stated he would ban Apple devices from his companies (Tesla, SpaceX, etc.) if ChatGPT is integrated at the OS level. He cited major security risks, sparking a wide debate on data privacy and the security of on-device vs. cloud-based AI processing.</li>
        </ul>
