            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Markets:</strong> JP Morgan strategists noted that while inflation remains a concern, strong corporate earnings are providing a supportive backdrop for equities. They advise a balanced approach, highlighting potential volatility ahead of upcoming central bank meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>Work & Culture:</strong> A recent report highlighted JP Morgan's ongoing "return-to-office" push for managing directors, reinforcing its stance on in-person collaboration for senior leadership to foster mentorship and client engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina Operations:</strong> The firm's local research team released an analysis on Argentina's latest inflation data, suggesting that while the monthly rate is decreasing, underlying pressures persist. They maintain a cautious outlook on the peso's short-term stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology & Fintech:</strong> The bank announced a strategic investment in a European fintech firm specializing in AI-driven compliance solutions, signaling its continued focus on leveraging technology to enhance regulatory processes and reduce operational risk.</li>

                <h3>Dólar Blue</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> Compra: $1,280 / Venta: $1,300</p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> The price has seen a slight increase in the last 24 hours, continuing a trend of volatility after a period of relative calm. The gap with the official dollar remains a key focus for the market.</p>
                <p><strong>Projection:</strong> Analysts expect continued pressure on the blue dollar, influenced by inflation expectations and upcoming political/economic announcements. A stable price will largely depend on the Central Bank's ability to accumulate reserves and anchor expectations.</p>

            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>Riesgo País (Country Risk)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Value:</strong> ~1,235 points</p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> Country risk has slightly decreased, reflecting positive market sentiment following recent successful debt auctions and fiscal discipline signals from the government. It remains well below its yearly highs.</p>
                <p><strong>Projection:</strong> The trend will heavily depend on progress with IMF negotiations and the implementation of structural reforms. A continued reduction is key to Argentina regaining access to international credit markets.</p>

                <h3>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF)</h3>
                <p><strong>Price:</strong> $547.80 <span class="positive">(+0.28%)</span></p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The market shows cautious optimism, grinding higher on the back of strong tech earnings. Sentiment is neutral-to-bullish, but the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential for a short-term pullback. Key drivers are inflation data and Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>$BTC (Bitcoin)</h3>
                <p><strong>Price:</strong> $67,850 <span class="negative">(-1.55%)</span></p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bitcoin is facing resistance around the $70k level, experiencing a minor pullback. Sentiment is mixed, with profit-taking by short-term holders being a primary factor. Market indicators show a consolidation phase. Continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are a positive long-term signal, but macroeconomic uncertainty is causing short-term headwinds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="market-item">
                <h3>$ETH (Ethereum)</h3>
                <p><strong>Price:</strong> $3,515 <span class="negative">(-2.10%)</span></p>
                <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Ethereum is underperforming Bitcoin slightly, following the broader crypto market dip. The initial hype from the spot ETF approval has subsided, and the market is now awaiting actual launch and inflow data. The RSI has cooled off, moving away from overbought conditions. The movement is largely correlated with Bitcoin's price action and overall market risk sentiment.</p>
