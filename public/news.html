            <h2>JP Morgan: Latest 24hs News</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Strategy:</strong> JP Morgan's chief global markets strategist has highlighted that while the market is currently enjoying a 'Goldilocks' scenario, investors should be prepared for potential volatility later in the year due to persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainties.</li>
                <li><strong>Work & Culture:</strong> The company continues its return-to-office push, with senior managers reinforcing the expectation of five days a week in the office. This policy remains a topic of discussion regarding its impact on work-life balance and talent retention in the post-pandemic era.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina Operations:</strong> JP Morgan's local branch continues to be a key player in advising on Argentina's debt restructuring and sovereign bond market. Recent analyses from the bank suggest cautious optimism regarding the country's economic path, contingent on sustained fiscal discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>Tech & Innovation:</strong> The bank has reportedly increased its investment in AI and machine learning for fraud detection and algorithmic trading, aiming to enhance security and gain a competitive edge in fast-moving markets.</li>

            <h2>Argentina: Dólar Blue & Riesgo País</h2>
            <div class="asset-card">
                <h3>Dólar Blue</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> Compra: $1,285 / Venta: <span class="price-up">$1,315</span></p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> The price shows an upward trend in the last day, increasing by approximately $20. The gap ("brecha") with the official dollar remains a key focus for the market.</p>
                <p><strong>Projection:</strong> Analysts expect continued volatility driven by local inflation data and central bank policy regarding currency controls. The short-term sentiment is cautious, with potential for further increases if economic uncertainty persists.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="asset-card">
                <h3>Riesgo País (Country Risk)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Value:</strong> <span class="price-down">1,215</span> basis points</p>
                <p><strong>Recent Changes:</strong> Argentina's country risk has seen a slight decrease over the past 24 hours, continuing a general downward trend observed in recent weeks. </p>
                <p><strong>Projection:</strong> The indicator's movement is closely tied to investor perception of the government's ability to meet its debt obligations and implement its fiscal adjustment plan. Positive negotiations with international creditors and stable macroeconomic indicators could lead to further compression.</p>

            <h2>Market Updates: SPY, BTC, ETH</h2>
            <div class="asset-card">
                <h3>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> ~$560.10 (<span class="price-up">+0.35%</span>)</p>
                <p><strong>Sentiment & Analysis:</strong> Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic. The price is hovering near all-time highs, supported by strong earnings from tech giants. However, indicators like the RSI suggest the market may be in overbought territory, signaling a potential for a short-term pullback. The primary driver remains the outlook on inflation and the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="asset-card">
                <h3>$BTC (Bitcoin)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> ~$67,800 (<span class="price-up">+4.5%</span>)</p>
                <p><strong>Sentiment & Analysis:</strong> Bullish sentiment has returned after a recent dip. The price has reclaimed a key support level around $66k. Positive movement is being attributed to renewed institutional interest and positive inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has moved from 'Fear' towards 'Neutral', indicating improving confidence. Resistance is now seen near the $70k mark.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="asset-card">
                <h3>$ETH (Ethereum)</h3>
                <p><strong>Current Price:</strong> ~$3,550 (<span class="price-down">-1.2%</span>)</p>
                <p><strong>Sentiment & Analysis:</strong> Sentiment is mixed to slightly bearish in the immediate short-term. While the broader crypto market shows some strength, ETH is underperforming Bitcoin. This movement is linked to uncertainty and lower-than-expected initial trading volumes for the newly launched spot Ethereum ETFs. Analysts are watching for sustained institutional inflows to act as the next major catalyst. The key support level is around $3,400.</p>
