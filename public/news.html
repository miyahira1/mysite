            <h2>JP Morgan: Latest 24hs News</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Strategy:</strong> JP Morgan's chief global markets strategist, Marko Kolanovic, reiterated a cautious stance on equities, warning that high valuations and concentrated market leadership pose significant risks. He advises clients to remain underweight on stocks and look towards commodities.</li>
                <li><strong>Working at JPM:</strong> The firm announced plans to bring more of its tech and operations staff back to the office five days a week, moving away from hybrid models for certain divisions to enhance collaboration and productivity. This follows a broader industry trend of increasing in-office mandates.</li>
                <li><strong>Argentina Focus:</strong> JP Morgan's latest report on Argentina highlights cautious optimism following recent debt restructuring talks. While the "Riesgo País" has decreased, the bank notes that sustained fiscal discipline and curbing inflation are critical for long-term investor confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>World Markets:</strong> The bank's wealth management division has slightly increased its allocation to emerging market debt, citing potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this year, which could make higher-yielding emerging market bonds more attractive.</li>

                    <strong>Dólar Blue:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current Price: <span class="price">Buy: $1,110 / Sell: $1,130</span></li>
                        <li>Recent Changes: The price shows stability, with a slight decrease compared to the previous week's highs, reacting to recent Central Bank interventions and positive signals from the government's fiscal policies.</li>
                        <li>Projection: Analysts expect continued volatility. The price is forecast to remain sensitive to inflation data and progress in negotiations with external creditors.</li>

                        <li>Recent Changes: A notable <span class="change-positive">decrease</span> from levels above 1,400 points last month. This improvement reflects growing market confidence in the government's economic plan and successful international debt negotiations.</li>
                        <li>Projection: The trend is expected to continue downward if fiscal targets are met. A sub-1,000 point level is seen as a key psychological barrier for attracting significant foreign investment.</li>

                    <strong>$SPY (S&P 500 ETF):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current Price: <span class="price">$550.15</span> (<span class="change-positive">+0.25%</span>)</li>
                        <li>Analysis: The market is showing cautious optimism ahead of a busy week of earnings reports from major tech companies. Sentiment is neutral-to-bullish, driven by hopes of a "soft landing" for the economy. However, traders are closely watching upcoming inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>$BTC (Bitcoin):</strong>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Current Price: <span class="price">$67,850</span> (<span class="change-negative">-1.10%</span>)</li>
                        <li>Analysis: Bitcoin is experiencing a minor pullback after a recent rally. The movement is largely technical, with the asset consolidating below the key $70,000 resistance level. Market sentiment is mixed, with long-term holders remaining bullish on institutional adoption, while short-term traders are cautious about potential regulatory news from the US.</li>

                        <li>Analysis: Ethereum is following Bitcoin's downward trend, facing resistance at the $3,500 mark. The recent approval of spot Ether ETFs has provided a positive long-term outlook, but short-term price action is tied to broader crypto market sentiment and macroeconomic factors. Activity on the network remains high, indicating strong underlying fundamentals.</li>
